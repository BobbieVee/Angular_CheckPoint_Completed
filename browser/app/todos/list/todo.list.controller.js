// define a `TodoListCtrl` controller that places injected
// `todos` (from a UI-Router state resolve) on the scope.
// It should have a scope method `setCategory` that changes
// `$scope.filterByCompleted` to certain values; a method
// `isActiveCategory` that confirms the current category;
// and a method `addTodo` that saves `$scope.toAdd` to the backend,
// then goes to that new todo's edit state.
